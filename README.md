# Ununoctium landing page

This is a simple single web page serving as a temporary landing page
for [ununoctium.dev](https://ununoctium.dev). It replaces my former personal
website [jm.potvin.xyz](https://jm.potvin.xyz) until its new (full) version is
ready to be published.

Public resources embedded under `/www/public/` stems from older CDN
[cdn.potvin.xyz](https://cdn.potvin.xyz). It is no longer active,
